## 📁 Repository Structure

| Folder       | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| [`I2C`](./I2C) | Demonstrates **Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)** communication between two Arduino boards (master-slave), showcasing basic data transmission and response handling. |
| [`NightWalkie`](./NightWalkie) | A wearable assistive device designed for navigation in the dark using ultrasonic sensors and buzzers. Inspired by bat echolocation, it alerts users via directional sound feedback. |
| [`PID`](./PID) | Implements a **PID controller** using **MPU6050** to achieve self-balancing behavior. Includes sensor fusion with accelerometer and gyroscope data, and real-time motor actuation logic. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project folder contains:
- A dedicated `README.md` for setup, code breakdown, and hardware requirements
- `.ino` files with modular, commented code
- Images, diagrams, or serial output samples (where relevant)

You can start exploring any folder independently depending on your interest.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To run any of the projects, ensure you have:
- **Arduino IDE** installed
- Required hardware modules (listed in each folder's README)
- Basic understanding of C++ and electronics
